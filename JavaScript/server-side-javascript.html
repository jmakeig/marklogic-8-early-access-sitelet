<h2>Server-Side JavaScript</h2>
<h3>What it is</h3>

<h3>Why it matters</h3>
<p>Server-side JavaScript allows developers to access the powerful query and data manipulation capabilities of MarkLogic in a language and with tools that they're already familiar with. Combined with JSON as a native data format, MarkLogic provides an ideal platform for building JSON-based services with JavaScript.</p>
<p>JavaScript has emerged as the language of the web. The move toward advanced applications in the browser and multi-disciplinary “devops” have pushed JavaScript and JSON to the command line, onto devices, down into middleware (à la Node.js) and now into the database itself. JavaScript has familiar C-like syntax with flexible typing, advanced OOP, and functional programming capabilities. </p>
<p>Because JSON <em>is</em> JavaScript, JavaScript is ideally suited for building and consuming JSON-based services, whether public or behind the firewall. MarkLogic's Server-side JavaScript implementation gives developers a friendly API to express queries, aggregates, and data manipulation while automatically distributing evaluation across a cluster to run in parallel, close to the data. MarkLogic has embedded <a href="https://code.google.com/p/v8/">Google's V8 engine</a>—the same one that powers <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en_us/chrome/browser/">Chrome</a>. V8 provides proven performance and stability as a front-end interface for the mature, high-performance C++ at MarkLogic’s core. </p>
<p>With Server-side JavaScript you'll:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>More easily get developers new to MarkLogic productive:</strong> Intuitive APIs and familiar syntax make working with MarkLogic more attractive.</li>
    <li><strong>Better integrate with existing skills and tools in your organization:</strong> Staff projects with resources you already have and attract and retain developers with an environment that will help them succeed.</li>
    <li>Access all of MarkLogic's proven capabilities through a pure JSON/JavaScript lens without having to compromise on performance, reliability, or security.</li>
    <li><strong>Better leverage your existing MarkLogic investment:</strong> Manage JSON, XML, and RDF data with JavaScript. Call XQuery existing library modules as if they were native JavaScript. Evaluate XPath (on both XML and JSON) from JavaScript. Issue SPARQL and SQL queries from JavaScript. Invoke and eval JavaScript from XQuery.</li>
  </ul>
<h3>Deeper dive</h3>
<div class="sidebar">
  <h4>Before you begin</h4>
  <p>This is the first Early Access release of Server-Side JavaScript. As such, there are still some rough edges and the APIs available today may change before general availability. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Only the Windows and Linux builds can evaluate server-side JavaScript in Early Access 2. OS X and Solaris will be supported in a future Early Access release. If you are running either of those OSes, a local virtual machine or cloud instance of Linux will be your best bet. </li>
    <li>Importing JavaScript library modules is not supported in Early Access 2. (Importing XQuery library modules into JavaScript has been implemented, though.) The planned implementation will look similar to Node.js's <code>require()</code> or <a href="http://people.mozilla.org/~jorendorff/es6-draft.html#sec-modules">ECMAScript 6’s modules</a>. Your <a href="">feedback</a> on this would be appreciated. </li>
  </ul>
</div>
<h4>1. Load Data</h4>
<p>Load some JSON documents using the built-in <code>xdmp.documentInsert()</code>. <code>declareUpdate()</code> tells the transaction manager that the current statement intends to change the database. Transactions are scoped to the entire statement. </p>
<pre class="sjs">`cat "01 Load Data.sjs"`</pre>
<h4>2. Search</h4>
<p>Build a query, run a search, and iterate through the results. </p>
<pre class="sjs">`cat "02 Search.sjs"`</pre>
<h4>3. Import XQuery</h4>
<p>JavaScript modules can import XQuery modules and access public functions and variables, just as an importing XQuery file could. XQuery names are automatically converted to <code>lowerCamelCase</code> in JavaScript. </p>
<pre class="sjs">`cat "03 Import XQuery.sjs"`</pre>
<h4>4. Update-Document</h4>
<p>Update complete JSON documents by reading them from the database, converting them to JavaScript objects (<code>.valueOf()</code>), and re-inserting them at their same URIs. It’s important to note that JSON nodes are <em>immutable</em>. That is you cannot directly change a JSON node from the database. You can either convert the JSON node to a JavaScript object or use the node update family of functions (see below). </p>
<pre class="sjs">`cat "04 Update-Document.sjs"`</pre>
<h4>5. Update-Node Replace</h4>
<p>Perform the same update as above, but use node-level updates, as opposed to rewriting complete documents. </p>
<pre class="sjs">`cat "05 Update-Node Replace.sjs"`</pre>
<h4>6. XMLBuilder</h4>
<p>The <code>XMLBuilder</code> API provides a lightweight interface for constructing XML nodes from JavaScript. Like a JSON node, an XML node can be saved in the database or manipulated in XQuery. </p>
<pre class="sjs">`cat "06 XMLBuilder.sjs"`</pre>
<h4>7. XPath</h4>
<p>Because JSON nodes in the database are nodes, in the XML Document Model (XDM) sense, you can access them with XPath. </p>
<pre class="sjs">`cat "07 XPath.sjs"`</pre>
<h4>8. XPath 2</h4>
<p>From XPath, JSON properties look like un-namespaced XML elements. MarkLogic also extends the XDM with <code>object-node()</code> and <code>array-node()</code> types. </p>
<pre class="sjs">`cat "08 XPath 2.sjs"`</pre>
<h4>9. OOP</h4>
<p>JavaScript supports functional, prototypical, and object-oriented programming styles. Any of these can be used as appropriate in MarkLogic. </p>
<pre class="sjs">`cat "09 OOP.sjs"`</pre>
<h4>1.0 Values</h4>
<p>MarkLogic supports the ability to create range indexes on JSON nodes. Server-side JavaScript (or XQuery) can access these using the built-in lexicon functions. </p>
<pre class="sjs">`cat "10 Values.sjs"`</pre>
<h4>11. JavaScript Eval</h4>
<p>XQuery modules can evaluate JavaScript (and SQL and SPARQL). <code>xdmp:javascript-eval()</code> allows access to external variables and does all of the mapping between XQuery and JavaScript data types. </p>
<pre class="xqy">`cat "11 JavaScript Eval.xqy"`</pre>
<h4>12. Clear Database</h4>
<p>Most functions that return multiple values from the database return iterators, rather than fully instantiated data structures. Iterators allow the E-node to lazily load data from the caches and/or D-nodes as it’s needed. The iterator interface is designed to implement the <a href="http://people.mozilla.org/~jorendorff/es6-draft.html#sec-operations-on-iterator-objects">ES6 interface</a>.</p>
<pre class="sjs">`cat "12 Clear Database.sjs"`</pre>
