  <h2>Developer Experience</h2>
  <p>Developing applications with MarkLogic has never been easier or more powerful. The new <em>Samplestack</em> demonstrates the advantages of MarkLogic in a complete Java/Spring and Angular.js application that a developer can explore and extend. Alongside an enhanced Java Client API, now Node.js developers too can efficiently access MarkLogic from an asynchronous JavaScript API, including the ability to manage and query JSON natively. For full-stack JavaScript development, MarkLogic  offers Server-Side JavaScript. This complements the client APIs and allows developers to reuse existing language skills and tools to run performance-intensive code in the database, as close to the data as possible. </p>
