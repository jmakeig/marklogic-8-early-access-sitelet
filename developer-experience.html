  <h2>Developer Experience</h2>
  <p>Developing applications with MarkLogic has never been easier or more powerful. The new Samplestack reference architecture demonstrates the power of MarkLogic in a complete Java/Spring and Angular.js application stack that a developer can deploy and explore in her own environment. Alongside an improved Java Client API, now Node.js developers can also effortlessly and efficiently access MarkLogic from JavaScript in their Node applications, including the ability to manage and query JSON natively. For full-stack JavaScript development, MarkLogic also offers Server-Side JavaScript. This complements the client APIs and allows developers to reuse the language skills and tools they likely already have to run performance-intensive code in the database, as close to the data as possible. </p>
